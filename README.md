# HangMan
HangMan coding challenge for OIT programmer position

I created this code in C++
I worked on it for 3 hours and 28 minutes. 
The source code is included in the three files: main.cpp Board.h and Board.cpp. 
All external libraries needed are included in the source code. 
It compiles properly and adheres to the challenge requirements, as far as I can tell. 
I did my very best. 
Thank you
